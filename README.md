### 1. About this project

For this project I used hypothesis testing and statistical analysis to answer multiple questions about the performance of the business.
I have tested multiple hypotheses for each question. I have moslty used **Welch's t-tests and one-way ANOVA tests**.


### 2. About the dataset

The Northwind database is an SQL server database created by Microsoft and simulates data from a fictional wholeseller of foods. I have  joined multiple tables in order to find the desired insight. 


### 3. Notebook overview

* Question 1: Does discount amount have a statistically significant effect on the quantity of a product in an order? If so, at what level(s) of discount?

* Question 2: What is the effect of discounts on revenue from sold products after discount?

* Question 3: Does the company receive larger orders in the two months preceding Christmas?

* Question 4: Does it matter which employee manages an order? Do some employees sell higher value orders?
